  <dc:description>The purpose of the project is to perform calculations and studies required for the design of electrical supply to different receiver power and lighting of a warehouse energy, whose activity consists in treating metals, so that the planned facilities allow carry out the production process. The electrical needs of the company in terms of which the electrical installation will be projected, defining the technical and security features, and gathering the minimum conditions and guarantees required by current regulations, in order to obtain administrative authorization will be studied competent bodies for commissioning. It is undertake the design and calculation of the electrical installation for industrial building for a business of metallurgy.</dc:description>

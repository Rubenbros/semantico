  <dc:description>This dissertation constitutes the final expression of a year-long learning process and aims to demonstrate a comprehensive acquisition of the knowledge, strategies and skills worked on during the Master in Teacher Training for Obligatory Secondary Education, Sixth Form, Professional Training and Language, Arts and Sports Teaching. The main focus is on communicativeness and group work and how implementing them by means of Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT) and Cooperative Learning poses a series of advantages over other approaches for both the students and the teacher.</dc:description>

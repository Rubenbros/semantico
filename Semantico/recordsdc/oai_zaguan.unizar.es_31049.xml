  <dc:description>Every Educational System plays a crucial role in every society. Consequently, Educational Systems have continously been making attempts to adapt theirselves to their societies' new necessities and the evolution and development of knowledge. This dissertation intends to provide a reflection on how autonomous learning and cooperative work could supply some of our society's and students' needs. In this context, students should be guided to raise awareness on their own learning styles in order to empower them with those learning strategies that suit them best. This would have a possitive impact on students' motivation and self-efficacy, allowing cooperative work to take place and become the most powerful learning tool.</dc:description>

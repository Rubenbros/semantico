  <dc:description>Due to the widespread advancement of English in the domain of academia (Crystal, 1997; Seidlhofer 2011), scholars from the field of applied linguistics have approached a new phenomenon in communication, the development of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF). The present study aims to contribute to an understanding of students’ attitudes towards ELF and their ensuing perceptions towards the teaching of ELF or EFL (English as a Foreign Language), the latter being the traditional way of teaching English in countries of the Expanding Circle. To this aim, qualitative tools were designed in order to compare the students’ attitudes, perceptions and experiences regarding ELF communication. Overall, results showed that the students were aware of some ELF features yet they relied on the native model when it comes to learning English. But that said, the students primed communication over grammatical correctness. The study suggests that although these students are aware of ELF communication features, they do not want this variety of English to be introduced in the teaching system because they identify and prefer to be taught a standard native model.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Due to present-day fostering of learning English as a foreign language, its teaching has evolved from a more traditional perspective to a focus on oral communication (Ellis, 2003; Richards, 2006). In this line, different methodologies are applied in education to meet this new need, one of this being Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT). In addition, an important variety of English nowadays is English for Specific Purposes (ESP), and for that, it is being more researched in the educational periods that applies. The present study aims to contribute to an understanding of Vocational Education students’ views and opinions towards TBLT and the implications of teaching following this methodology or a more traditional one in this specific context. To this aim, qualitative tools were designed in order to compare the students’ views and opinions regarding TBLT. Overall, results showed that the students were aware of the usefulness of this methodology yet they relied on traditional teaching methods when it comes to learning English. The study suggests that although these students are aware of the impact of TBLT in their learning process, they do not seem to fully rely on this methodology to learn English because they have always being taught following a traditional presentation-practice-production approach.</dc:description>

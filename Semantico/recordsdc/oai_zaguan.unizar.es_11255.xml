  <dc:description>An existing physicochemical treatment is tried to be optimized controlling different parameters of sedimentation part and raw materials use. Wastewater from a dye industry is collected and characterised. The first batch is treated using a coagulation-flocculation process to remove large particles remaining in the sludge (primary treatment). The product is completely separated in supernatant solution and sludge. Supernatant is sampling for different flocculants concentration. A new polyelectrolyte (PDADMAC) is tested in terms of alkalinity and the results are compared with current electrolyte (PAC). Supernatant from primary treatment process is fed to ultrafiltration unit (UF) (secondary treatment). The permeate outlet from UF is fed to nanofiltration (NF) where almost all organics and solids are removed. A tertiary treatment refines the water product of nanofiltration membranes using commercial polymeric membranes with embedded aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Before applying the hybrid membranes a full detailed study has been carried out in terms of CNTs embedment, water and wastewater flux permeability and SEM microscopy. Polymeric membranes embedded with CNTs have been made in the laboratory with spin coating method and by ultrafiltration unit size exclusion is tested using PEGs solutions.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The objective of this paper is to present Daisy Buchanan as femme fatale as well as a manifestation of the ideal of the American Dream after the First World War in the novel The Great Gatsby. The impressions of Daisy are acquired by the reader through the narration of Nick Carraway, who presents this character as a new and liberated woman in the context of the decade of the 20’s, often referred to as “The Roaring Twenties”. The work centers on the fatal relationship between Daisy Buchanan and Jay Gatsby, emphasizing the characteristics which this relationship offers to the study of the female protagonist as femme fatale and a symbol of the American Dream, a corrupted dream that turns out to be unreachable and at the same time destructive for Jay Gatsby, who ends up obsessed by everything that Daisy represents and by the impossible idea of recovering, or even repeating, the past after the war.</dc:description>

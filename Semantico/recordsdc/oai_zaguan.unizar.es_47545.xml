  <dc:description>The project is based on a previous experiment carry out by two students. The aim is to prove if the results of the experiments are correct. To do this, we are going to observe, evaluate and see all the experiment done before and to can appreciate in a correct way, we’ll transfer in the known Stress-Strain graphic. Finally, we’ll compare the graphics from the real experiments obtained by MATLAB with the graphics from ABAQUS and extract some conclusions.  We model the behaviour of a cast iron used for engine parts in Scania trucks. The parts are subjected to thermomechanical fatigue (TMF), which is both varying mechanical and temperature load. The behaviour due to an out-of-phase (OP) load, compression at maximum temperature, is to be characterised and modelled. The part will experience compression at maximum temperature and when unloaded/loaded cyclic it will experience tension at lower temperature.</dc:description>

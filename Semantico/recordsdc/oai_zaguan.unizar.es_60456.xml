  <dc:description>The symmetry is an important gait feature that is measured and reported frequently, particularly in patients with hemiparesis. For many rehabilitation professionals a goal of gait re-education is the achievement of symmetry during locomotion.  The purpose of the study is to examine changes in gait symmetry following the training with an audio feedback device in patients with hemiparesis. The project has been developed in collaboration with Sant Joan de Déu Hospital (HSJD) that has provided with the patients involved in the study. Gait analysis was acquired in the Biomechanics Laboratory of the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) using an optical system and the kinematic analysis was performed using the software OpenSim.  The audio feedback device (Walking o’clock) evaluated is a prototype developed by a Spanish company. The device contains an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to measure the absolute angle of a segment, and it is connected via wi-fi to a computer where the therapist can see the value. Walking o’clock is placed on both tights of the patients with a velcro strap and it makes a sound when it reaches a threshold value. This value is selected by the therapist according to the gait pattern that he wants to correct.  Through a kinematic analysis we will try to check if the use of this audio feedback device produces changes in the symmetry of gait. For this purpose, joint angles, range of motion, angular velocity and eight spatiotemporal parameters have been calculated and analyzed for four patients with hemiparesis. From the results, it was shown that the device decreases the asymmetry of some gait parameters, but at the same time increases it in others. There are factors that influence the response to feedback such as the instruction given to the patient, the selection of the threshold angle, and the training time with the device. This report describes all the processes involved in the analysis, as well as the methodology used. A biomechanical human model was developed to reproduce the motion as close to reality as possible using the software OpenSim. Then, an inverse kinematic analysis was implemented to obtain the range of motion of the joints produced by the patient during the gait cycle. Also, an analysis of the spatiotemporal parameters was included in the study.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The main objective of this TFG is to make a product for the naval field from the selection of an item available on the market (bowsprit for downwind sails) to make it an improvement or a modification to offer the cheaper product and accessible for all boaters. At present, this element is expensive due to use for a few years ago. According to navigation criteria and types of boats in the market, has opted for the realization of a polyvalent bowsprit because can be installed in most sailboats. It will perform a study market of such booms to acquire information and to see if we can offer this product range to other sizes of sailboats, for smaller boats, in addition to a simple and cheap product to bring production the first units to be manufactured. A prototype will be made in the workshop.</dc:description>

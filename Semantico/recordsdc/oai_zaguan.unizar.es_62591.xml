  <dc:description>ABSTRACT Intercultural competence (IC) is defined as the ability to interact with people from other cultures, acting in intercultural appropriate ways (Hammer et al., 2003). This dissertation describes the results of a survey conducted on senior undergraduate students of the Degree in English Studies at the University of Zaragoza in order to explore the extent to which they are interculturally competent and aware of multiculturality. The dissertation draws on the relevant theoretical perspectives on intercultural competence, mainly Michael Byram’s (1997) work. Overall, results show that the students have achieved a considerable degree of intercultural competence and that they appreciate and are open to multiculturality. This can best be seen in their predisposition to participate in intercultural encounters and learn from them.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This is an essay about the use of animation as a vehicle for propaganda, using the World War II Disney cartoon short Der Fuehrer's Face (1943) and the North Korean television show Squirrel and Hedgehog (1970-) as examples. The essay analyzes and compares these two cartoons focusing on their ideological content as well as on how their technical aspects and features as animation works are used to deliver their propagandistic message. It describes the mechanisms of propaganda and how it works, and more concretely how caricaturization and humour are used in propaganda to depict the enemy in a negative light. It also pays attention to the historical context of both texts, taking into account how propaganda is used differently in contemporary North Korea and 1940s USA in terms of methods, intended audience and technical aspects.</dc:description>

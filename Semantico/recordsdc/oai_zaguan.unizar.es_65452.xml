  <dc:description>This work has been developed in order to contribute to the current demands of this interconected and changing world. Nowadays, we live in a digital and globalized era which requires a deep methodological change in education, making essential the development of 21st century skills and learning English as a foreign language effectively. PBL together with CLIL seem to give an answer to these needs being both student-centered approaches which facilitate the learning of new content, SLA and the development of 21st century skills such as: creative and critical thinking, and cooperative and digital skills among others.  This is why this study would like to demonstrate that CLIL and PBL are two complementary and beneficial approaches to learning a second language, by designing a CLIL project proposal for 6th grade in Primary Education that will be explained in the subsequent pages.</dc:description>

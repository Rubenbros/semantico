  <dc:description>Since birth, children need to understand the world where they live and learn.  That knowledge is achieved through the exploration of their environment with adults supporting their development, which is related to science learning. Moreover, children achieve socialization step by step and one of the best strategies to understand their environment and socialize is “playing”.  Through play, they learn to interpret their world, to interact with others and to use language to express their ideas and feelings.  The present study focuses on describing learning through science play in order to provide some materials related to this idea to be used in English as a Second Language classroom.</dc:description>

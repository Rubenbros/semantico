  <dc:description>People with physical disabilities have been facing a lot of challenges every day because of lack of infrastructure. For them getting around in a city is a difficult task. Roads, stores, parks, offices, schools, theatres and even houses have been designed without taking this group into consideration. It has been a difficult challenge to design a device for wheelchairs, which could improve their mobility while experiencing Nordic walking/cross-country skiing. This report goes through the process of the concept development for this wheelchair add-on.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The main objective of this dissertation is to bring to the fore the important role that certain allophones and allophonic features can have when teaching English pronunciation in Spanish Secondary Education classrooms, taking English as a Lingua Franca as a framework. First of all, the phonemes and allophones that should be worked on in this teaching context have been indicated. In order to select them an analysis of six well-known manuals about English pronunciation as well as Jenkins’ (2000) Lingua Franca Core have been taken as the basis. Secondly, those selected sounds have been sequenced throughout the four years of Secondary Education. In order to justify this sequencing, several aspects have been considered: how relevant they are from an intelligibility point of view, how similar or different they are compared to students’ mother tongue in terms of articulation, how challenging the sound-spelling association may be and the functional load. Thirdly, six lesson plans have been designed to develop students’ receptive and phonological competence in relation to the previously selected allophones. These lessons are integrated into the topics and also grammatical and lexical aspects of the books Interface 1, 2, 4. In order to design them Celce-Murcia et al.’s (2010) five-step framework to the teaching of pronunciation following a communicative approach has been applied. Overall, the objective is to put forward a proposal to integrate the teaching of relevant allophonic feature in Spanish secondary Education.</dc:description>

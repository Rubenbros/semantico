  <dc:description>An analysis of the learning unit I planned to teach to secondary education students, reflecting on those aspects I accomplished favourably, and proposing new alternatives to the factors that we cannot consider as propitious for a well-structured English class. I also mention and inspect closely my proposal to introduce peer-assessment in secondary education, defending the idea that when students are asked to assess partners, they are encouraged to reflect on their own process of learning, and it perhaps is a valuable step to students’ ultimate goal of learning to learn. I explain the direct connection that exists between that learning unit and the assessment proposal, since the first one precisely comes from the evaluation criteria established in our regional regulations (the Aragonese Curriculum), whereas the second one reflects on how successful the teaching-learning sequence was, drawing the circular movement of teaching, which starts and ends in the evaluation patterns.</dc:description>

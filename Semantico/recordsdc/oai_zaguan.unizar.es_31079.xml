  <dc:description>This Trabajo Fin de Grado has the goal to go into detail into the theory of multiple intelligences. In order to do that, it will be divided into two main parts. Firstly, the theory of multiple intelligences, its origins, other theories of intelligence and each one of the intelligences and the main key points of the theory will be explained. Apart from this, the relationship of this theory with other learning theories such as collaborative learning and constructivist learning will be dealt with the aim to explain how to adapt for the English classroom. Secondly, the dissertation will focus on the design of activities aimed at the different types of intelligences to be applied in an English language classroom.</dc:description>

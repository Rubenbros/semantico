  <dc:description>In this report it can be found the description about Héctor Fuentes Final Project. It starts with some basic concepts which introduce the reader to the working field. After that there is the index, in order to make a fast search for a specific content, followed by the introduction which gives a general vision about the aim of the project. The main description which continues enumerates in detail every work done about the project. It starts with a work description in time and contents, and then there is every board design proof, which explains widely the PCBs operation as well as hardware and software matters. The conclusion talks about what has been done, what could be done instead, and how good is the project implementation. Every document used in this project (datasheets, PDFs, and so on) is named in the literature section. At the end, there is the appendix, where is possible to find the PCB schematics, information about how to program the microcontroller and DVD index.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In this final master project model cell membranes of a mixture of 1, 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and cholesterol were transferred onto mica substrates by Langmuir-Blodgett technique (LB) to mimic a real cell membrane. The high quality and chemical structure of the monolayers formed were confirmed by means of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging and Contact Angle measurements. A study of the stability of the monolayer in liquid media considering the amphiphilic nature of the compounds was carried out, observing as the monolayer re-assembled into bilayer. This behaviour was explained by means of Force Spectroscopy (FS) studies with a noticeable increase in the breakthrough force values. Furthermore, the deposition of MNPs onto monolayer was carried out by LB in a successful way obtaining a well-covered distribution of MNPs with the final purpose of study the membrane response when it is exposed to alternating magnetic fields (Hyperthermia).</dc:description>

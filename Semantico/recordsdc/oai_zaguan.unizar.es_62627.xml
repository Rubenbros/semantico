  <dc:description>The gobal economic crisis added to the growing number of cases of corruption have made citizens to lose the trust they had on public administrations. Due to this, the population demands the management of the public funds to be efficient, effective and transparent. For this reason, a research work has been carried out with the aim of knowing the level of transparency at local level in Spain and comparing it with the United Kingdom, a country that is known as highly transparent. In this way, recommendations can be made to improve the results obtained for our country. To achieve this goal, twenty-one variables have been selected and applied to the twenty-five most populated municipalities of each of these two countries. The results conclude that although most of the city councils obtain a high punctuation, they should keep on trying to improve the information disseminated.</dc:description>

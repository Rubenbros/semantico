  <dc:description>This paper aims to reflect on the results of the action research which was personally conducted in the English language lessons of a reduced group of the Programa de Diversificación curricular of 4th grade over a three weeks period. The purpose of study was to explore the effects of ICT as a teaching tool in the language classroom. The results are presented in terms of second language acquisition and students‘ motivation. The overall inference of the research is that students have a more positive attitude towards language learning when they are presented with engaging and challenging activities through technological devices that can better meet their generational needs. Nonetheless, results show that students continued with the same language level and skills may eventually were not significantly improved due to the short term nature of study.</dc:description>

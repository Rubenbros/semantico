  <dc:description>In Thinks… (2001) David Lodge rescues some of the classical generic conventions of the campus novel, a genre considered by many experts worn out and old-fashioned, in an attempt to reopen C.P. Snow’s two-cultures debate and to uplift the realm of arts in the world of academia. Lodge manages to play with a large variety of narrative strategies that suit to perfection character types and ideas. In this dissertation I intend to analyse Thinks... as a contemporary campus novel and to explore its contribution to the debate between science and humanities, taking into account both the formal and thematic aspects of the novel.</dc:description>

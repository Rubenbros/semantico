  <dc:description>This Trabajo Fin de Máster summarizes the main learning and most relevant competences acquired while completing the Master focused on the teaching profession that I have been taking in the specialty of English. It is divided into three main sections. First of all I make some reflections about my process of learning in each course. Then, in the second section, I present and self-assess the sub-competences I acquired in each module and I present through a summarizing chart the main competences of the Master I have achieved at the end of that section. I will synthesize my innovation research project in the third part, and I will finish by explaining the importance of my future permanent training, putting forward some of the ways of developing it.</dc:description>

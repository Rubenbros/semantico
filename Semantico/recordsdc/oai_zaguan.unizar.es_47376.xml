  <dc:description>The use of ICTs in CLIL has been an effective technique in order to teach the contents and language of the second language, but little research has been done on the perceptions that both teachers and students have about CLIL and how ICTs function in the classroom. The present work describes how CLIL has been working in primary schools in Zaragoza since its implementation and how teachers use ICTs to teach the contents and language of the bilingual subject to students. Then, an analysis on the perceptions of both teachers and students about ICTs has been carried out in order to determine how effective the use of ICTs to learn a second language by means of CLIL has been up to now.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The communicative approach is rapidly gaining ground in second language teaching as the need to communicate in the target language becomes greater. However it is still unclear which tasks and types of pairing are more effective. This study was undertaken in an attempt to clarify which types of communicative task (open or closed) better promoted production and in addition if the type of pairing had any effect on student interaction. The results obtained throw some light on the subject as there is evidence that different pairing level is a key factor to task outcome. In addition to this, task types were also shown to be an important variable. Findings may inspire Primary Schools teachers to carefully evaluate the tasks and type of pairings they use in order to help students to obtain higher oral fluency.</dc:description>

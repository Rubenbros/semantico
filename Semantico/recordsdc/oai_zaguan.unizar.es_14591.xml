  <dc:description>The way in which literacy is being taught in Spain has changed in the recent years. A Synthetic Phonics approach has very often been adapted from Britain to our Spanish schools. This study analyzes how this adaptation and implementation is being carried out in foreign language lessons and what is required in order to deliver effective literacy teaching. In doing so, a checklist and a questionnaire have been carried out in one British school as well as in three Spanish schools. All the literature read and analyzed, as well as the results obtained from the observations have enabled us to propose some improvements, which adapted to the context, will ensure high-quality and effective literacy teaching.</dc:description>

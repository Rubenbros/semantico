  <dc:description>This project deals with the design of the ocular expression and animation of TUK, an animal-like robot developed in order to help autistic children. The target of this thesis is to design and build a structure for the required actuators, as well as covering their implementation and control. Eyes, eyelids and the pieces which are part of the different mechanisms will be manufactured. Finally, a set of expressions for the robot will arise as a result of the developed movements. Apart from these technical aspects, the fact that this project has a therapeutic aim concerning children with autism cannot be forgotten. As a result, during the design, factors such as a friendliness, robustness, safety, cleanliness, and appeal have been kept in mind.</dc:description>

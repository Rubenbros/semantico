  <dc:description>This essay explores the alleged influence of traditional fairy tales in Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights (1847), analyzing two aspects that could support such a statement. Firstly, it shows how Emily Brontë was familiar with fairy tales and how she could be influenced by their magical taint. Secondly, I will explore the use of different elements and patterns used in Wuthering Heights, which appear in specific fairy tales such as Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast, in order to illustrate the similarities and differences with respect to Brontë’s novel. Finally, this dissertation puts forward how Brontë was able to launch a critique on her contemporary society, precisely using gothic and supernatural elements, which resemble the use of fantasy in the above-mentioned fairy tales.</dc:description>

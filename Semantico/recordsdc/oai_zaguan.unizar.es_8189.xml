  <dc:description>A dedicated device was built with the purpose of studing the remotely controlled drug release of a temperature sensitive hydrogel in a water flow. Samples of the hydrogel (semi-interpenetrating polymer networks constituted by alginate and PNIPAAm) with in situ synthesized magnetite nanoparticles (average size 10nm) were characterised by TEM, STEM/EDS, SEM, VSM and power dissipation measurements. These results were used to design and construct a system able to measure the drug release of the samples in a water flow when exposed to an external RF field. The device was calibrated to obtain absolute values of drug concentration in the water flow in real time by a built-in photometer. Vitamin B12 was used as model drug. First results indicate a good response of both the sample and the device. Field induced drug liberation events were clearly recorded. A liberated B12 mass in the order of 10ng was calculated for each event. Further experiments are necessary for a complete characterization of the drug release process.</dc:description>
